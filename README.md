# ND Addon

**ND** (short for non-destructive) is a Blender addon that provides many workflow enhancements, tools, operations, and generators tailored specifically for non-destructive 3D modelling.

This approach is useful for many types of modelling needs, particularly hard-surface forms, while being able to quickly adjust parameters without the need for manual poly-modelling. ND modelling makes extensive use of modifiers to enable this flexible workflow.
